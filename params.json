A new tool [MyopicVicar](https://github.com/FreeUKGen/MyopicVicar) for loading image sets into the Scribe system and attaching them to data-entry templates. \r\n2. Modifications to the [Scribe system](https://github.com/FreeUKGen/Scribe) to handle our volunteer organization's workflow, plus some usability enhancements.\r\n3. A publicly-accessible search-and-display website to mine the database created through data entry. \r\n4. A reporting, monitoring, and coordinating system for our volunteer supervisors. \r\n\r\nWe also plan to add support for geocoding during transcription and GIS support within the search and display system. Currently, initial development is mostly finished with 1 and moving on to 2 and 3 above.\r\n\r\nAlthough this tool is focused on support for parish registers and census forms, we are intent on creating a general-purpose system for any tabular/structured data.   Scribe's data-entry templates are defined in its database, with the possibility to assign different templates to different images or sets of images.  As a result, we can use a simple template for a 1750 register of burials or a much more complex template for an 1881 census form.  Since each transcribed record is linked to the section of the page image it represents, we have the ability to display the facsimile version of a record alongside its transcript in a list of search results, or to get fancy and pre-populate a transcriber's form with frequently-repeated information like months or birthplaces.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of Ben Laurie, the trustee directing the project, we are committed to open source and open data.  We're releasing the source code under an Apache license and planning to build API access to the full set of record data.\r\n\r\n## How to Help\r\nWe need your help to make this the best project it can be, and there are plenty of ways to contribute:\r\n\r\n1.
